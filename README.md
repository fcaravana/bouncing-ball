# bouncing-ball

Project bouncing ball.

When the user clicks on the page, a ball is fired from the clicked position at a random speed and angle.

The projectile should react to gravity force.

When the projectile reaches the bottom of the browser window it should bounce until it stops.

Add gulp file to minify and automate.
